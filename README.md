Aim: To create three different fragments from main Activity and show them on the 
on the activity screen.

Approch:
1) here we have taken three different country capitals as buttons.

2)On clicking these buttons we have brought the related fragment and made sure
it is shown on the activity page

3)here we have taken three blank fragments for each button to show upon action

conclusion:
Here the beginners of android development can learn how the fragment is used.

Note:
Most people think fragments as  different activity. The reason for using fragment
is it is much effiecent way then creating an activity.
An activity is used for bigger purpose where for small scale operations one can use
fragments.
